## Standalone scripts

### Seasonal trend charting

**Description:** This script fetches historical stock data and visualizes price trends.

**Usage:** Specify the stock ticker and the period of interest in the script variables.

**Example Commands:**
```bash
python seasonality_charting.py AAPL 5y monthly
```
```bash
python seasonality_charting.py AAPL 5y weekly
```

### Backtest trailing stop-loss

**Description:** 
This script provides a basic framework for backtesting the ATR-based trailing stop loss method. Adjust the parameters like num_trades, shares, atr_multiplier, and the date range for more tailored backtesting based on specific trading strategies or different market conditions.
**Implementation:**
The script initially calculates the ATR for each day across the entire dataset using a rolling window of 14 days. This means that for any given day \(t\), the ATR is calculated based on the previous 14 days, including day \(t\). When making a simulated purchase at a randomly selected day, it uses the ATR calculated at that point.

1. **ATR Calculation**:
   - The script calculates the True Range (TR) for each day using the highest of the following three values:
     - The difference between today's high and low (\( \text{High} - \text{Low} \)).
     - The absolute difference between today's high and the previous close (\( |\text{High} - \text{Previous Close}| \)).
     - The absolute difference between today's low and the previous close (\( |\text{Low} - \text{Previous Close}| \)).
   - It then calculates the ATR by taking a rolling average of the True Range over the last 14 days.

2. **Simulated Purchase**:
   - The script selects random dates from the historical data and simulates purchases on those dates.
   - For each simulated purchase, it starts checking each subsequent day to determine if the stock's price falls below the trailing stop loss level, which is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Trailing Stop Loss} = \text{Peak Price since Purchase} - (\text{ATR at Current Day} \times \text{Multiplier})
     \]
   - The "Peak Price since Purchase" is updated daily if the current price is higher than the previous peak price.

3. **Using ATR from Purchase Day Onwards**:
   - The ATR used for the trailing stop calculation is from the day of purchase and every subsequent day until the position is exited. This means that if a purchase is made on day \( t \), the ATR from day \( t \) (which reflects the volatility of the previous 13 days plus day \( t \)) is used to calculate the initial trailing stop. For each following day, the updated ATR (reflecting its respective 14-day period) is used.

This approach ensures that the ATR used for the trailing stop calculations is dynamically updated to reflect recent market conditions, providing a realistic and practical application of volatility-based stop loss strategy.

## Interface
### Overview
The Stock Analysis Interface is a web application built with Dash and Python, designed to provide users with financial analysis of stocks. The application allows users to input a stock ticker symbol, upon which it displays various financial metrics such as Beta, Expected Return, Book Value Per Share, and a trailing stop loss price calculated using the Average True Range (ATR).

### Features
- Stock Ticker Input: Enter any stock ticker to retrieve financial data and analysis.
- Real-time Analysis: Get up-to-date financial analysis including Beta, Expected Return, and Book Value Per Share based on the most recent data from Yahoo finance.
- Trailing Stop-Loss Target: Automatically calculates the best trailing stop loss price using ATR. The ATR provides a measure of an asset's volatility over a specified period, allowing traders to set stop losses based on actual market conditions rather than arbitrary fixed distances. This makes the ATR-based trailing stop loss particularly useful in volatile markets where price swings are significant. This method dynamically adjusts to reflect the assetâ€™s typical price movements, providing a balanced approach that aims to minimize premature exits during normal market fluctuations while protecting profits from significant reversals. The ATR-based trailing stop loss is a popular choice among traders who wish to tailor their risk management strategies to better align with the volatility and price dynamics of the assets they are trading.
