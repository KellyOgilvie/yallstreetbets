## Interface
### Overview
The Stock Analysis Interface is a web application built with Dash and Python, designed to provide users with financial analysis of stocks. The application allows users to input a stock ticker symbol, upon which it displays various financial metrics such as Beta, Expected Return, Book Value Per Share, and a trailing stop loss price calculated using the Average True Range (ATR).

### Features
- Stock Ticker Input: Enter any stock ticker to retrieve financial data and analysis.
- Real-time Analysis: Get up-to-date financial analysis including Beta, Expected Return, and Book Value Per Share based on the most recent data from Yahoo finance.
- Trailing Stop-Loss Target: Automatically calculates the best trailing stop loss price using ATR. The ATR provides a measure of an asset's volatility over a specified period, allowing traders to set stop losses based on actual market conditions rather than arbitrary fixed distances. This makes the ATR-based trailing stop loss particularly useful in volatile markets where price swings are significant.

ATR-Based Trailing Stop Loss Method:

Setting the Stop Loss: Determine a multiplier, commonly 1.5 to 3 times the ATR, depending on the desired tightness of the stop. The trailing stop loss is then set a fixed distance from the high price (for long positions) or low price (for short positions) based on this calculation.
Example: If the ATR is $5 and you choose a multiplier of 2 for a long position, your trailing stop loss will be set $10 below the highest price reached since entering the trade.
This method dynamically adjusts to reflect the assetâ€™s typical price movements, providing a balanced approach that aims to minimize premature exits during normal market fluctuations while protecting profits from significant reversals. The ATR-based trailing stop loss is a popular choice among traders who wish to tailor their risk management strategies to better align with the volatility and price dynamics of the assets they are trading.
